# Basic Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation
This project aims to personal re-implementation some basic machine learning algorithms like: Linear Regression, KMeans Clustering...

# Prequisition
To make sure all of this project's code works, please spend a minute installing some libraries according to the requirements.txt file. 
Just run "pip install -r requirements.txt" after activating your Python Virtualenv.

# K Means Clustering
## Implementation and Visualize the points with Pygame
"python/python3 KMeans_Clustering/pygame_beginer.py"
## Compress Image
This code simply replace an image with K-a number-main colors. This example use K=8 means that the image we get after running this code only has 8 main colors left.
"python/python3 KMeans_Clustering/compress_image_with_kmeans.py"

# Linear Regression
Calculate the weights (a, b) in the line function f(x) = ax + b using Gradient Descent. Visualize the weights change step by step
"python/python3 Linear_Regression/main.py"
